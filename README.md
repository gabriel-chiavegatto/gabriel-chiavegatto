## Hello world, I'm Gabriel

I'm Developer student from Brazil;

I met the programming world through the 'C' language, then turned my focus to web development. This year i started at Driven Education, one of the first steps to becoming a software engineer.

In the last few months I've been developing some front end projects with **Javascript** and **React**. Now I'm excited to learn backend and keep improving my frontend skills.
